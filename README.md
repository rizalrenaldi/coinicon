#### v1.0 | 56 cryptocurrency icons  

coinicon is a stilation (a simple version) of cryptocurrency logo (and/or) icon. All of these icons are my personal reinterpretation of the actual logo without changing any essential part of the visual, and keeping the icon identifiable as it is.

coinicon is made by Rizal Renaldi a.k.a HelloSignal.

### Icons

Existing version (1.0) contains 64 cryptocurrency icons based on actual market cap top rank from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) in early November 2017.

Use each currency's actual code with the ci- prefix.

`<i class="ci ci-btc"></i>`  
`<i class="ci ci-eth"></i>`   
`<i class="ci ci-ltc"></i>`

___

### Sizes

coinicon's based size is 48px. Shrink it down using suffix `-s`, and make it larger using `-m` and `-l`. Create your own set of sizes by overriding this suffix.

`<i class="ci-s ci-btc"></i>`  
`<i class="ci ci-btc"></i>`  
`<i class="ci-m ci-btc"></i>`  
`<i class="ci-l ci-btc"></i>`  

___

### Colors

Pre-configured color is set for each icon. So far, only NAVcoin and Ripple that has gradient color.

`<i class="ci ci-btc btc-color"></i>`  
`<i class="ci ci-eth eth-color"></i>`  
`<i class="ci ci-eth etc-color"></i>`  

Special treatment on Ethreum and Ethereum Classic. Since both share same icon, use `.ci-etc` for both icon, and use `.eth-color` for Ethereum's color and `.etc-color` for Ethereum Classic's color.

___

### Round Frame

Round frame variation using the same color with colored icon. Easily combine it with size suffix.

`<i class="ci-s ci-btc btc-round"></i>`  
`<i class="ci ci-neo neo-round"></i>`  
`<i class="ci-m ci-xrp xrp-round"></i>`  

Special treatment on Ethreum and Ethreum Classic. Since both share same icon, use .ci-etc for both icon, and use .eth-round for Ethereum's round color and .etc-round for Ethereum Classic's round color.
